# TODO

- #0000002: Can we make this less process intensive? and move it to another place. I think that the access might be a correct place. Maybe use the indexes or something
- #0000003: Write tests
- #0000004: Cleanup
- #0000005: Update the readme
- #0000006: order the package names in the installation wizard widget
- #0000007: Better formatting of the installation wizard widget needed
